<h3>Framework Notes</h3>
<p>Included in the Concierge Tools for Eclipse feature is a plugin that bundles the Concierge OSGi runtime.  This code was authored by Jan  S. Rellermeyer Information and Communication Systems Research Group (IKS), Institute for Pervasive Computing, ETH Zurich.
	When launching a CTE project, this framework gets executed.  It is possible to use a different framework (assuming the launch style is compatible) or a different version by replacing the cg_framework.jar.  
	At this time the filename is hard-coded, so the file will have to be replaced.  Any additional jars can be places in the same plugin/jars directory such that they can be started from the Concierge Bundles section of the launch configuration.</p>
