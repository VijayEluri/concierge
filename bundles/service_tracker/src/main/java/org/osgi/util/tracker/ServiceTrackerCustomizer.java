/**
 * The <tt>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</tt> interface allows a <tt>ServiceTracker</tt> object to customize
 * the service objects that are tracked. The <tt>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</tt> object
 * is called when a service is being added to the <tt>ServiceTracker</tt> object. The <tt>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</tt> can
 * then return an object for the tracked service. The <tt>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</tt> object is also
 * called when a tracked service is modified or has been removed from the
 * <tt>ServiceTracker</tt> object.
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface may be called as the result of a <tt>ServiceEvent</tt>
 * being received by a <tt>ServiceTracker</tt> object. Since <tt>ServiceEvent</tt>s are
 * synchronously delivered by the Framework, it is highly recommended that implementations
 * of these methods do not
 * register (<tt>BundleContext.registerService</tt>), modify
 * (<tt>ServiceRegistration.setProperties</tt>) or unregister
 * (<tt>ServiceRegistration.unregister</tt>)
 * a service while being synchronized on any object.
